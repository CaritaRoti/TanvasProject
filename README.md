# TanvasProject - University project for creating touch screen interfaces with haptic feedback

-Proof-of-concept prototype version-

TanvasProject uses the TanvasTouch device to provide haptic feedback for touch screen graphical interfaces.
The program builds the haptic feedback interface based on the contents of a XAML file, meaning that a designer can freely 
design a GUI and automatically generate a haptic interface to it. As a proof-of-concept prototype, the program 
currently supports buttons and sliders.

TanvasProject requires the TanvasTouch drivers to be installed on your device, 
currently available from the Tanvas website through the TanvasTouch devkit: https://tanvas.co/products/tanvastouch-dev-kit
